//! Initialization message detailing general information about the charge point (e.g version, vendor etc.).
//!
//!  # Behaviour
//! After start-up, a Charge Point SHALL send a request to the Central System with information about its
//! configuration (e.g. version, vendor, etc.). The Central System SHALL respond to indicate whether it will accept the
//! Charge Point.
//! The Charge Point SHALL send a BootNotification.req PDU each time it boots or reboots. Between the physical
//! power-on/reboot and the successful completion of a BootNotification, where Central System returns Accepted or
//! Pending, the Charge Point SHALL NOT send any other request to the Central System. This includes cached
//! messages that are still present in the Charge Point from before.
//!
//!  # Response
//! When the Central System responds with a BootNotification.conf with a status Accepted, the Charge Point will
//! adjust the heartbeat interval in accordance with the interval from the response PDU and it is RECOMMENDED to
//! synchronize its internal clock with the supplied Central Systemâ€™s current time. If the Central System returns
//! something other than Accepted, the value of the interval field indicates the minimum wait time before sending a
//! next BootNotification request. If that interval value is zero, the Charge Point chooses a waiting interval on its
//! own, in a way that avoids flooding the Central System with requests. A Charge Point SHOULD NOT send a
//! BootNotification.req earlier, unless requested to do so with a TriggerMessage.req.
//!
//! If the Central System returns the status Rejected, the Charge Point SHALL NOT send any OCPP message to the
//! Central System until the aforementioned retry interval has expired. During this interval the Charge Point may no
//! longer be reachable from the Central System. It MAY for instance close its communication channel or shut down
//! its communication hardware. Also the Central System MAY close the communication channel, for instance to
//! free up system resources. While Rejected, the Charge Point SHALL NOT respond to any Central System initiated
//! message. the Central System SHOULD NOT initiate any.
//!
//! The Central System MAY also return a Pending registration status to indicate that it wants to retrieve or set
//! certain information on the Charge Point before the Central System will accept the Charge Point. If the Central
//! System returns the Pending status, the communication channel SHOULD NOT be closed by either the Charge
//! Point or the Central System. The Central System MAY send request messages to retrieve information from the
//! Charge Point or change its configuration. The Charge Point SHOULD respond to these messages. The Charge
//! Point SHALL NOT send request messages to the Central System unless it has been instructed by the Central
//! System to do so with a TriggerMessage.req request.
//!
//! While in pending state, the following Central System initiated messages are not allowed:
//! RemoteStartTransaction.req and RemoteStopTransaction.req
