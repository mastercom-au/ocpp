//! Request from chargepoint to begin an energy transaction. Must be sent before charging will begin.
//!
//! # Behaviour
//! If this transaction ends a reservation (see Reserve Now operation), then the StartTransaction.req MUST contain the reservationId.
//! If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of a StartTransaction.conf PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the cache
//! entry, if the idTag is not in the Local Authorization List, with the IdTagInfo value from the response as described under Authorization Cache.
//!  
//! # Response
//! Upon receipt of a StartTransaction.req PDU, the Central System SHOULD respond with a StartTransaction.conf PDU. This response PDU MUST include a transaction
//! id and an authorization status value. The Central System MUST verify validity of the identifier in the StartTransaction.req PDU, because the
//! identifier might have been authorized locally by the Charge Point using outdated information. The identifier, for instance, may have been blocked
//! since it was added to the Charge Pointâ€™s Authorization Cache.
//!
//! It is likely that The Central System applies sanity checks to the data contained in a StartTransaction.req it received. The outcome of such sanity
//! checks SHOULD NOT ever cause the Central System to not respond with a StartTransaction.conf. Failing to respond with a StartTransaction.conf will
//! only cause the Charge Point to try the same message again as specified in Error responses to transaction-related messages.
